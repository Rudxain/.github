# Intro
Don't be shy! All my repos are open to contributions and suggestions (even style/format requests)

## Issues & Pull Requests
- Avoid opening duplicate issues and/or PRs, reuse existing ones if those are related
- Any PR diff-size is accepted, but small PRs are preferred because they're easier/faster to review. Big PRs are *dreams and nightmares* **simultaneously**

## Style & Formatting
- [One of the reasons why I prefer tabs over spaces](https://dev.to/alexandersandberg/why-we-should-default-to-tabs-instead-of-spaces-for-an-accessible-first-environment-101f)
- If you type a subjective comment, surround it within quotes, and include your name (display-name, username, user ID, etc...). Example: `# "I couldn't find a better alterntive" @ghost`. This is required to avoid confusion (for future readers) caused by *unintentional impersonation*. This way, everyone knows who said what, without seeing the git-blame. Objective comments (like `# this X implementation has better performance than Y`) don't need usernames
- In case of doubt, search for patterns in the way the code is written, and please try to replicate those patterns, for consistency

## etc
- I'm not supporting Apple's non-standard HTML icons, they must adhere to web standards (unless they request a change and it gets accepted)
- I'm not supporting HTML Twitter-Cards, it's redundant, I already have enough with Open-Graph madness
