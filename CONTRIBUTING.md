Don't be shy! All my repos are open to contributions and suggestions (even style & formatting requests).

- Any pull-request diff-sizes are accepted, but small PRs are preferred because they're easier/faster to review. Big PRs are *dreams and nightmares* **simultaneously**.
- One of the many reasons why I prefer tabs over spaces: https://dev.to/alexandersandberg/why-we-should-default-to-tabs-instead-of-spaces-for-an-accessible-first-environment-101f.
- In case of doubt about style and formatting, search for patterns in the way the code is written, and please try to replicate those patterns, for consistency.
- I'm not supporting Apple's non-standard HTML icons, they must adhere to web standards (unless they request a change and it gets accepted).
- I'm not supporting HTML Twitter-Cards, it's redundant, I already have enough with Open-Graph madness.
